    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      A sushi platter is a visually stunning and delicious assortment of
      Japanese delicacies.<br />
      It typically features an array of fresh fish and seafood, such as tuna,
      salmon, and shrimp, arranged artfully on a platter.<br />
      Each piece of sushi is a harmonious blend of flavors and textures, from
      the tender fish to the slightly sticky, vinegared rice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The platter often includes a variety of sushi types, such as nigiri,
      sashimi, and maki rolls.<br />
      Nigiri consists of a slice of fish atop a small mound of rice, often
      garnished with a dab of wasabi.<br />
      Sashimi showcases the pure, unadorned flavor of fresh fish, thinly sliced
      and served without rice.<br />
      Maki rolls are created by rolling fish and vegetables in seaweed and rice,
      then slicing into bite-sized pieces.<br />
      The sushi platter is typically garnished with pickled ginger, wasabi, and
      soy sauce, adding extra layers of flavor and color.

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the sushi rice under cold water until the water runs clear.</li>
        <li>Cook the sushi rice according to the package instructions.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt until dissolved.</li>
        <li>Once the rice is cooked, transfer it to a large bowl and gently fold in the vinegar mixture. Allow the rice to cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Prepare the fish and vegetables by slicing them into thin, even strips or pieces.</li>
        <li>Place a sheet of nori on a bamboo sushi mat, shiny side down.</li>
        <li>Wet your hands with water to prevent sticking, then spread a thin layer of sushi rice over the nori, leaving a 1-inch border at the top edge.</li>
        <li>Arrange slices of fish, avocado, and cucumber in a horizontal line across the rice.</li>
        <li>Using the bamboo mat, carefully roll the sushi away from you, pressing gently to keep the roll tight.</li>
        <li>Once rolled, use a sharp knife to slice the roll into bite-sized pieces.</li>
        <li>Arrange the sushi pieces on a platter, along with nigiri and sashimi if desired.</li>
        <li>Garnish the platter with pickled ginger, wasabi, and soy sauce.</li>
